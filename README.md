This meta-regression analyzed existing studies to examine the association between ADHD symptomatology and caffeinated beverage consumption using R

Although previous literature has identified the association between ADHD symptomatology and stimulant use such as cigarettes and cocaine, as well as an association between ADHD symptomatology and sugary and soft drink consumption, no meta-analysis to date has explored whether an association exists between ADHD symptomatology and caffeinated beverage consumption existed. To explore this relationship and potential moderators, a meta-regression was conducted. The meta-analysis identified a statistically significant association between ADHD symptomatology and caffeinated beverage intake with a correlational effect size of 0.11 (p<0.001). Energy drink consumption was shown to have a marginally significant moderating effect on this association (p=.1089). Future studies should explore the potential mechanism behind the moderating effect of energy drink consumption on this relationship.
